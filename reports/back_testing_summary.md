# Backtesting Summary:
The strategy portfolio, which uses optimized weights derived from our forecast model, was backtested against a simple benchmark portfolio consisting of a static 60% SPY and 40% BND allocation over the period August 2024 to July 2025. The backtest results indicate that the strategy achieved a Sharpe ratio of approximately 0.90 compared to 0.85 for the benchmark, suggesting better risk-adjusted returns. However, the benchmark yielded a slightly higher total return (~10.3%) versus the strategyâ€™s return (~8.6%). The cumulative returns plot further illustrates the comparative performance trends over the year. Holding the initial portfolio weights without monthly rebalancing simplifies the backtest but leaves room for future enhancement. Overall, this initial backtest demonstrates that the model-driven strategy is competitive and has the potential to outperform a standard benchmark, but further refinements and dynamic rebalancing could enhance returns and reduce risk.
